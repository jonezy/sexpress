# swig + express = sexpress

### What is sexpress?

sexpress is a starting point for building node apps using the swig
templating engine (my personal favourite).

It comes with the following stuff

- Node.js + Express
- Grunt based build system
- Swig Templating Engine
- Twitter Bootstrap
- 1140px Grid System

### What is it good for?
- Internal projects
- Prototyping ideas

### Getting Started

- git clone git://githu.com/yourusername/sexpress.git ./project-name
- cd project-name && rm -rf .git
